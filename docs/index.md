# Production Scheduler

Welcome to the official documentation for the Production Scheduler Software. This guide aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the software, ensuring that users can effectively plan, manage, and optimize their production tasks.

## Introduction

The Production Scheduler Software is an innovative solution designed for modern manufacturing environments, bridging the gap between planning and execution. It leverages a comprehensive set of tools to manage jobs, tasks, resources, and dependencies. Whether you're managing a small workshop or a large-scale manufacturing facility, this software provides the flexibility and precision required to keep production running smoothly.

### Key Features:
- **Intuitive Job Management:** Easily define, modify, and track jobs.
- **Advanced Task Scheduling:** Manage task relationships, resources, and timelines.
- **Resource Allocation:** Group and allocate resources efficiently with weekly shift templates.
- **Dependency Tracking:** Monitor and manage task dependencies and exceptions.
- **Operational Flexibility:** Handle operational exceptions and adjust resources as needed.

## Software Overview

**Jobs:**  
At the heart of the system lies the 'Job' entity. Each job, identified by a unique ID, encompasses a series of tasks and their associated dependencies. Every job can be detailed with attributes like due dates, customer details, and notes.

**Tasks:**  
Tasks represent individual production activities. They can be associated with one another (predecessor and successor relationships), and they require specific resources. Tasks also have defined setup times, run times per unit, and teardown times, ensuring accurate scheduling.

**Resources & Resource Groups:**  
Resources are the workforce or machinery required to complete tasks. These can be grouped into 'Resource Groups' for easier management and allocation.

**Dependencies:**  
Dependencies can be thought of as prerequisites. They come in various types and can be associated with both tasks and jobs. By effectively tracking dependencies, the software ensures that tasks or jobs do not commence until all necessary conditions are met.

**Operational Exceptions:**  
The software is built with real-world challenges in mind. It provides tools to handle operational exceptions that might affect resource availability or task execution.

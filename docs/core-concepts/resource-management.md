# Resource Management

Understanding your resources is the first step in making your production work well. This section explains the basics of how to manage your machines and staff in FactryFlow.

## Resources

In FactryFlow, a "Resource" is any physical entity that contributes to the production process. This could be a piece of machinery like a CNC machine or a skilled laborer. Resources are the fundamental building blocks of your production environment. Understanding how to manage them effectively is the first step in optimizing your operations.

For example, consider a factory that specializes in metal fabrication. In this setting, a CNC machine that cuts metal sheets would be considered a resource. Similarly, the operator who runs the machine is also a resource. Both are essential for the task of cutting metal sheets, which in turn is part of a larger jobâ€”say, producing 100 units of a particular metal component.

## Resource Groups

Organizing your individual resources into "Resource Groups" allows for more efficient management and easier scheduling. For instance, you could have a resource group named "Machining" that includes all your CNC machines, lathes, and milling machines. Another group could be "Assembly," which includes workstations and personnel responsible for assembling finished parts.

Using the same metal fabrication factory as an example, all CNC machines could be grouped under a "Machining" resource group. This allows the production manager to easily allocate all machining-related tasks to this group, thereby streamlining the scheduling process.

## Weekly Shift Templates

Weekly Shift Templates in FactryFlow define the availability of each individual resource for every day of the week. For example, you could set up a shift template that allocates a particular CNC machine only for the morning shift from 9 AM to 1 PM. This feature is crucial for effective scheduling as it ensures that tasks are only allocated to resources when they are available.

In a practical scenario, a specific CNC machine could be set to operate only during the first shift, which runs from 6 AM to 2 PM. This ensures that all tasks requiring this machine are scheduled within this timeframe, making optimal use of the available resource.

## Operational Exceptions

Operational Exceptions in FactryFlow account for both unexpected and planned events that affect resource availability. This could range from a machine breakdown to scheduled maintenance or planned leaves taken by staff. Knowing how to manage these exceptions is crucial for maintaining a smooth production schedule.

For example, if a CNC machine in the "Machining" group is scheduled for maintenance, it would be marked as an operational exception for the duration of the maintenance period. This alerts the system and the production manager that the machine is not available, allowing for the reallocation of tasks to other available resources, thereby minimizing disruptions.

# Dependency Types

When scheduling production, it's crucial to recognize various dependency types that can influence the process. By understanding these dependencies, users can ensure a smooth workflow, minimal interruptions, and optimized resource allocation. Moreover, in our production scheduling software, users have the capability to add dependency constraints directly to tasks and jobs, ensuring that all requirements are met before proceeding. Below, we've outlined the primary dependency types and provided examples for clarity.

### **1. Materials & Components**
**Description:**  
This category represents the fundamental raw materials, parts, or components required for the manufacturing process. The specific materials can range widely based on the product.

**Examples:**  
- Specific plastic resin needed for toy manufacturing.  
- Brake assemblies vital for car production.

### **2. Machinery & Equipment**
**Description:**  
Critical machinery or equipment necessary for various tasks are highlighted in this category. The state of this equipment, whether it's operational, requires calibration, or installation, can impact production timelines.

**Examples:**  
- A downed CNC machine that halts a production line.  
- A malfunctioning conveyor belt requiring immediate repairs.

### **3. Technical Specifications**
**Description:**  
Before kick-starting a manufacturing process, there are essential technical details, drawings, or design specifications to be considered. These provide the blueprint for the manufacturing process.

**Examples:**  
- CAD drawings necessary for launching a new product line.  
- Design specifications needed to create a new mold.

### **4. Quality & Compliance**
**Description:**  
Quality assurance and regulatory compliance form this category. It signifies both the internal quality checks a product must undergo and the external regulations and certifications a process or product must adhere to.

**Examples:**  
- A product batch pending a quality control inspection.  
- A new manufacturing process that needs an environmental safety certification before it starts.

### **5. Logistics & Suppliers**
**Description:**  
Any challenges or dependencies related to the supply chain fall under this category. From transportation hitches to supplier delays, these logistical concerns can influence the scheduling timeline.

**Examples:**  
- Production delay due to a key supplier facing issues with their own supply chain.  
- Raw materials held up in customs, causing a production hold.


By embedding these dependencies as constraints in tasks and jobs, our software allows for a proactive approach to potential disruptions. This not only provides better visibility but also ensures better resource allocation, more accurate timelines, and a more efficient production process overall.

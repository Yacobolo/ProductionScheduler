# Database Naming Convention Style Guide

In the realm of database design, clarity and consistency are paramount. Adhering to a clear set of naming conventions makes your database both easier to understand and more maintainable. Here's a concise style guide for your database naming.

## Key Naming Conventions

### Avoid Quotes

Use names like `first_name` or `all_employees` instead of `"FirstName"` or `"All Employees"`.

### Lowercase Only

Stick to lowercase letters for identifiers, e.g., `first_name` and `team_member`.

### No Data Type Names

Go for descriptive names instead of data types. Instead of `timestamp` or `text`, use terms like `creation_date` or `description`.

### Underscores for Spacing

Use underscores to separate words in an identifier, like `word_count` or `team_member_id`.

### Full Words, Not Abbreviations

Always prioritize clarity. Instead of `mid_nm`, use `middle_name`.

### Exceptions to Abbreviations

Use abbreviations only when they are widely accepted, such as `i18n` for "internationalization".

### Steer Clear of Reserved Words

To avoid conflicts, don't use terms like `user`, `table`, or `lock`.

## Relation Naming

### Singular Names for Tables and Views

Use singular terms like `team` instead of plurals such as `teams`.

### Primary Keys

Typically, use `id` for single-column primary keys.

### Foreign Keys

Combine the referenced table's name and the field names. If a `team_member` references a `team`, the foreign key should be `team_id`.

Remember, clarity and consistency are paramount when designing and naming your database elements.
